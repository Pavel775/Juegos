## Godot Multiplayer Setup Tutorial - Reference Project

Hello and welcome.

This repository contains reference material for two tutorials that can be found on my web page [kehomsforge.com](http://kehomsforge.com), both related to multiplayer games with Godot.

The first tutorial can be found [here](http://kehomsforge.com/tutorials/multi/gdMultiplayerSetup). It contains very basic multiplayer game setup with Godot, with a non authoritative server. The result of the first tutorial is in the master branch of this repository.

The second tutorial, which is a follow up to the first, contains some advanced topics as well as some fixes to some oversights of the first tutorial. In it, an authoritative server is implemented. The result of it can be found on the *MoreNetworking* branch and the tutorial itself can be found [here](http://kehomsforge.com/tutorials/multi/gdMoreNetworking).

I now have a networking addon that automates most of the process shown in the tutorials allowing for an easier process to synchronize networked multiplayer games with snapshots. The addon is part of a *pack* and can be found [here](https://github.com/Kehom/GodotAddonPack) (check it's readme for a link to a set of tutorials related to the addons in the pack).
